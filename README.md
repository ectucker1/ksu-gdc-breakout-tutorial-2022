# ksugdc-breakout-tutorial-2022

This is the code result of the Breakout tutorial during a Fall 2022 GDC meeting.
It's a game programmed with the Godot game engine,
though it should hopefully give you good ideas if you're looking to use other tools.

The game includes the main features of Breakout - a bouncing ball, paddle, and breakable bricks.
It also includes a couple more chaotic features requested during the meeting.

The best files to look at for learning are:

- paddle.gd
- paddle.tscn
- ball.gd
- ball.tscn
- brick.gd
- brick.tscn

Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions about how the game works.
